When the atmospheric pressure increases from $P_a = P_0$, the fluid rises in the barometric tube while it descends in the cistern. As a result, the added mass in the tube increases, while the added mass in the cistern decreases. We denote $m_{1,tb}$ and $m_{1,c}$ the (algebraic) variation of the apparent masses of each container. Thus, the tensions exerted by the two cables can be written:<br> $[F_0 + m_{1,tb} g] \\vec{u_x}$ for the cable on the right, suspending the tube;<br> $-[F_0 + m_{1,c} g] \\vec{u_x}$ for the cable on the left, suspending the cistern.<br>According to the principle of mass conservation, one can immediately state that $m_{1,tb} = -m_{1,c}$. Subsequently, we choose to keep only $m_{1,c}$ in the expressions (but all the calculations can be carried out while keeping $m_{1,tb}$ ).<br>The friction force between the support and the mass $M$ needed to maintain the equilibrium is therefore given by $$ \\vec{R_t} = -[F_0 - m_{1,c} g] \\vec{u_x} + [F_0 + m_{1,c} g] \\vec{u_x} = 2m_{1,c} g \\vec{u_x} $$ In addition, according to the sketch above (where displacements $\\delta_b$ and $\\delta_c$ are algebraic), we have $m_{1,c} = \\rho S_c \\delta_c$.<br>It is now necessary to determine $\\delta_c$. One can use<br> the hydrostatic law: $\\delta_b - \\delta_c = \\frac{P_1}{\\rho g}$ <br> the conservation of the total volume/mass of mercury: $S_b \\delta_b = -[S_c - S_t]\\delta_c \\approx -S_c \\delta_c$ (given that $S_t \\ll S_b, S_c$ )<br>Solving the system formed by those equations, one finds $$ \\delta_c = -\\frac{S_b}{S_b + S_c - S_t} \\frac{P_1}{\\rho g} \\approx -\\frac{S_b}{S_b + S_c} \\frac{P_1}{\\rho g} $$ which finally yields $$ \\vec{R_t} = -\\frac{2 S_b S_c}{S_b + S_c - S_t} P_1 \\vec{u_x} \\approx -\\frac{2 S_b S_c}{S_b + S_c} P_1 \\vec{u_x} $$ With the triangular model for $P_1(t)$, the maximum static friction force is obtained when $P_1 = \\pm A$. Therefore, according to the Coulomb's law of friction, the mass $M$ stays at rest if and only if $$ \\frac{2 S_b S_c}{S_b + S_c - S_t} A < F_s $$ This inequality can be rewritten as $$ 2 < \\frac{S_b + S_c - S_t}{S_b S_c} \\frac{F_s}{A} = \\xi $$ which allows us to identify $$ \\xi^* = 2 $$",

From there, the mass $M$ is continuously accelerated by the total tension $\\vec{T}$ until it is blocked by the stop at $x=X$. According to Fig. 5, one can assume that $X$ is of the order of a few centimeters, so the time needed to switch between the two positions $x=0$ and $x=X$ can reasonably be neglected in front of the period $\\tau_1$.<br>Once blocked at $x=X$, the resultant tension $\\vec{T}$ can be determined by generalizing the reasoning carried out in the two previous questions. One obtains the following equations:<br> hydrostatic law: $\\delta_b - \\delta_c = \\frac{P_1}{\\rho g}$ <br> conservation of the volume/mass: $S_b \\delta_b + (S_c - S_t) \\delta_c = (S_c - S_b + S_t) X$ <br>The resolution of this system gives $$ \\delta_c = \\frac{S_c - S_b + S_t}{S_b + S_c - S_t} X - \\frac{S_b}{S_b + S_c - S_t} \\frac{P_1}{\\rho g} $$ from which we deduce the perturbative added mass $$ m_{1,c} = \\rho S_c (\\delta_c - X) = -\\rho \\left[ \\frac{2S_c(S_b - S_t)}{S_b + S_c - S_t} X + \\frac{S_b S_c}{S_b + S_c - S_t} \\frac{P_1}{\\rho g} \\right] = -m_{1,tb} $$ Then finally $$ \\vec{T} = -2m_{1,c} g \\vec{u_x} = \\left[ \\frac{4S_c(S_b - S_t)}{S_b + S_c - S_t} \\rho g X + \\frac{2S_b S_c}{S_b + S_c - S_t} P_1 \\right] \\vec{u_x} $$ According to Coulomb's law of friction, the mass $M$ will stay at rest at the position $x=X$ while $\\vec{T} \\cdot \\vec{u_x} > -F_s$.
